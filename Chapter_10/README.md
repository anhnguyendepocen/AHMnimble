# Notes on AHM examples from Chapter 10

- NIMBLE with default samplers is more efficient than JAGS for the examples in this chapter.

- For the example in 10.4, the posteriors between NIMBLE and JAGS are not as clearly matched as we like to see.  This may be an indication that longer runs are needed.
