# Notes on examples from AHM Chapter 7

- Examples in 7.6.2 and 7.9.7 still need to be implemented.
- The example in 7.8.4 is inefficient (mixes slowly) in both NIMBLE (with default samplers) and JAGS, and JAGS is a bit more efficient.  This would be a good example for re-writing the model and/or designing customizing sampling strategies in NIMBLE to try to improve efficiency.
