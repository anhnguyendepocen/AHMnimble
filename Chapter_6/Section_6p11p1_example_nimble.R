# Incorporated errata up to 19 May 2017
# Code updated to implement new names and changes to functions in AHMbook package 0.1.4
# Use built-in data sets instead of .csv files
# In Chapter 11, replaced 'Y', 'Ysum' and 'Yaug' with lower case 'y', 'ysum' and 'yaug'

# 6.11.1 Bayesian fitting of the basic ZIP N-mixture model
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Note that this model contains "toggle" parameters that switch parts of the
# model on and off.  In this case, the three random effects
# are all turned off (hlam.on = hp.survey.on = hp.site.on = 0).
# This means that the random effects and their standard deviations 
# (sd.lam, sd.p.site, sd.p.survey) will just follow their priors.
# Nevertheless, they are being sampled, and this results in a substantial
# amount of wasted computation time.
# In the comparisons later, we will turn off the relevant samplers in NIMBLE.

# Parameters monitored
params <- c("theta", "ltheta", "phi", "beta0", "beta", "alpha0", "mean.p", "alpha", "fit.actual", "fit.sim", "bpv", "c.hat", "Ntotal263")

# MCMC settings
ni <- 50000    ;    nt <- 4    ;    nb <- 10000    ;    nc <- 3

# Call nimble from R and summarize posteriors:
out1 <- nimbleMCMC(code = Section6p11_code, 
                   constants = win.data1, 
                   inits = SGT_inits_full,

                   thin = nt,
                   samplesAsCodaMCMC = TRUE)

## provied in the original book code for JAGS.

## For this example, we will set up some different sampler configurations in NIMBLE:
## 1. A configuration that does not waste time sampling nodes that are turned "off" by toggle variables.
## 2. A configuration like (1) and also samples some nodes by Automated Factor Slice Samplers.
## 3. A configuration like (1) and also samples some nodes by Adaptive Random-Walk Metropolis-Hastings block samplers.
