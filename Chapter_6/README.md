# Notes on AHM examples from Chapter 6

- NIMBLE's default samplers and JAGS have similar efficiency for 6.3 and 6.4.

- For 6.4, we tried the automated factor slice sampler of [Tibbits et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2013.791193) for pairs of coefficients.  This yielded a large boost in efficiency.

- 6.11.1 and 6.11.2 need to be cleaned up and run.
