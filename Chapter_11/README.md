# Notes on examples from Chapter 11

NIMBLE (with default samplers) and JAGS each do better on some examples in Ch. 11.

There may be a problem with the example in 11.7.1 because the posteriors do not match well.  Longer runs may be needed, or there may be some other issue.

Section 11.10 has not been converted into a NIMBLE example yet.
