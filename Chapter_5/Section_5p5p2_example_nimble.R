### Last change: 19 May 2017 by Mike Meredith
# Incorporated errata up to 19 May 2017
# Code updated to implement new names and changes to functions in AHMbook package 0.1.4
# Use built-in data sets instead of .csv files
# In Chapter 11, replaced 'Y', 'Ysum' and 'Yaug' with lower case 'y', 'ysum' and 'yaug'
#  to match the code in the printed book.

# This file requires that Section_5p3_example_nimble.R has been run.

## All responses are missing:

## Bundle data: simply drop the response from list
win.data <- list(M = length(Cm), elev = elev, forest = forest)

## Alternatively, add all-NA data vector
win.data$Cmean <- as.numeric(rep(NA, length(Cmean)))
str(win.data)  # Cmean is numeric

## Parameters monitored
##params <- c("alpha0", "alpha1", "alpha2", "alpha3", "sd", "mu[1:2]")
params <- c("alpha0", "alpha1", "alpha2", "alpha3", "sd", "mu")

## Take steps to build, configure and compile MCMC.

out1.2 <- nimbleMCMC(code = section5p3_code,
                     constants = win.data,
                     inits = inits,
                     monitors = params,
                     nburnin = nb,
                     niter = ni)

library(coda)
out1.2.mcmc <- as.mcmc(out1.2)

library(mcmcplots)
mcmcplot(out1.2.mcmc[,1:6])
## These chains are not very well mixed.
## They could be run longer, or different samplers could be used.

print(out1.2.mcmc[,1:6], 2)

## Further plots from AHM book code do not work due to different MCMC object formats.
