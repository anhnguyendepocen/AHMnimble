### Last change: 19 May 2017 by Mike Meredith
# Incorporated errata up to 19 May 2017
# Code updated to implement new names and changes to functions in AHMbook package 0.1.4
# Use built-in data sets instead of .csv files
# In Chapter 11, replaced 'Y', 'Ysum' and 'Yaug' with lower case 'y', 'ysum' and 'yaug'
#  to match the code in the printed book.
