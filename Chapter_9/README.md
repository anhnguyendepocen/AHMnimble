# Notes on AHM examples from Chapter 9

- There are a couple of examples in Ch. 9 where NIMBLE's default samplers are much less efficient than JAGS (9.2.2, 9.8.3, 9.8.5).  This needs investigation.

- There is one example where NIMBLE may be much more efficient than JAGS (9.3.2), but there may be some problem with this example because the posteriors of NIMBLE and JAGS do not match.  This needs investigation.
